### Analysis of the National Strategic Plan 2019-2024: Observations and Perspectives from International Standards

After analyzing the National Strategic Plan 2019-2024 of the Federal Government in Mexico, it was found that key terms such as transparency, climate change, indicators, clean energy, social justice, human rights, economic growth, technology, innovation, equity, and inclusion were scarcely mentioned throughout the document. These terms embody fundamental concepts for sustainable development and social well-being, and their absence or limited emphasis raises significant concerns from a global perspective.

The lack of a clear focus on transparency and human rights could undermine public trust and institutional legitimacy, which are essential pillars of effective governance. Similarly, deprioritizing technology, innovation, and economic growth risks limiting the country's ability to compete in an increasingly digitalized and competitive global economy.

Moreover, equity and inclusion—critical cross-cutting principles for any public policy—are essential to ensuring that the benefits of development reach all sectors of society, regardless of origin or socioeconomic status.

It is imperative that a plan of this scope integrates these issues not as isolated references, but as core principles guiding the government's vision and actions. Failure to do so risks misalignment with international standards and jeopardizes the country's sustainable development in the long term.
